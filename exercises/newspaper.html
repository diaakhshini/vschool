    <h3>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years </h3>
    <h5>Director Demands Investigation</h5>
    <p><img src="img.jpg"> LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the <span>CIA</span> has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
    
    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
</p>
    <p><em>CIA</em> Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 

* the Cold War
* the civil-rights movement 
* the growth of the international drug trade
